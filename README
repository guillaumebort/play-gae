Play! framework plugin that allows for the deployment of any Play! application to Google App Engine.

More information on: http://www.playframework.org/modules/gae.


Build by running `build.sh`.

`play gae:deploy` and the other commands defaults to OAUTH2. Adding two parameters `--username=foo --password=bar` makes it use username:password instead.

Push releases to the gh-pages branch so they'll show up here:
